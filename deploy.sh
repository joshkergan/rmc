# TODO(david): Uncomment the two lines below to re-enable compiling and
#     minifying JS. This involves doing the following:
#     1. Fix this compile step: running this will result in an error right now.
#        This runs the Require.js optimizer (see
#        http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html), which parses out and
#        tries to run the contents of `require.config({})` in
#        server/static/js/main.js. However, in github.com/UWFlow/rmc/pull/161 we
#        moved the raw JSON contents of main.js:require.config() into its own
#        file, config_settings.js, in order to facilitate a consistent
#        environment for JS tests.
#     2. Change JS_DIR in flask_prod.py from 'js' to 'js_prod', where the
#        minified files end up. This will require producing source maps and
#        configuring Airbrake to use them.
